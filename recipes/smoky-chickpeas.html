        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>From culinarycolleen.com, very loosely based on 
            Mark Bittmanâ€™s Fried Chickpeas With Chorizo and Spinach.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cups cooked chickpeas</li>
            <li>1 tbsp paprika</li>
            <li>Salt, to tast</li>
            <li>5 ounces fresh baby spinach</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>Fresh-squeezed lemon juice (optional)</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to tast</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the 
                chickpeas and paprika; toss to coat evenly. Season with a pinch 
                of salt and cook for at least 10 minutes, or until the chickpeas 
                are sort of toasty looking but not burnt.</li>
            <li>Add the spinach and cook until just barely wilted. Meanwhile, 
                fry the eggs.</li>
            <li>When the spinach is wilted, season additional salt and pepper to taste. 
                Squeeze a little lemon juice on top of each serving and top with a 
                fried egg.</li>
        </ol>
