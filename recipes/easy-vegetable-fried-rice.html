        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Stir fried rice is really a great springboard for adaptation. 
            This one is simply flavored and has more than four cups of chopped and 
            sliced vegetables, such as carrots, peppers, and broccoli—though you can 
            change up the vegetables as you like!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
            <ul>I used one bag of stir fry veggies instead of -
                <li>1 cup broccoli crowns and stems</li>
                <li>1 cup chopped carrots</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded cabbage</li>
                <li>1 cup diced zucchini</li>
                <li>1/2 cup thinly sliced bell pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            </ul>
            <li>1 cup frozen shelled edamame or peas</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>3 cups cooked and cooled white or brown rice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon peeled and minced fresh ginger</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons finely minced garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil, regular or spicy</li>
            <li>1/2 cup thinly sliced scallions, white and light green parts, 
            plus more for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the veggies: Heat a wok or a large skillet over high heat 
                until very hot. Add 1 tablespoon of oil, and then the broccoli, 
                carrots, cabbage, zucchini, peppers, and edamame.  Stir often until 
                the vegetables are crisp-tender, about 4 minutes (they will get 
                another few minutes to cook at the end of the stir fry so it's ok 
                if they're still crunchy right now). Transfer them to a plate and set 
                aside.</li>
            <li>Scramble the eggs: Season the beaten eggs with a little salt and pepper. 
                Heat 1 more tablespoon of oil in the same wok or skillet over high 
                heat. Add the beaten eggs and scramble quickly, just about 1 minute. 
                When they are just cooked through, slide them out onto the plate with 
                the vegetables.</li>
            <li>Stir fry the rice: Return the wok to the burner over high heat, add 
                the remaining tablespoon of oil, then add the cooled rice. 
                Stir fry, stirring occasionally, until it is lightly browned in 
                spots, about 5 minutes. Add the ginger and the garlic to the rice, 
                and stir until they're fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the soy sauce, 
                sesame oil, and 1/2 cup scallions.</li>
            <li>Finish the stir fry: Return the vegetables and eggs to the wok with 
                the rice. Cook, stirring often, until everything is combined and hot 
                and the vegetables are just tender, about 3 minutes. Taste and adjust 
                the seasonings with salt and pepper, if needed.</li>
            <li>Garnish and serve: Sprinkle the additional scallions over the top, 
                and serve right away, passing soy sauce on the side for those who 
                want a bit more.</li>
         </ol>
